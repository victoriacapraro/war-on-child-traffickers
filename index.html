        The "war on child traffickers" isn't as big as you think it is.

      <h2>
        The statistics about how many children in the U.S. go missing every year are doctored and inaccurate. And as the far-right rallies around #SavetheChildren, that's a big problem.

        From the Epstein scandal, to the Wayfair conspiracy, to "Pizzagate," misinformation has spread about human trafficking in the U.S. this year. Here is a look into accuracy some of the most popular statistics on the
        internet right now:

        This meme is widely circulated on the #SaveTheChildren and other trafficking hashtags. It claims that 800,000 children in the U.S. disappear each year. If this were true, then about 7% of all children in the U.S. would disappear annually.
        <br><br>
        The number comes from a 2002 Department of Justice study that looked at missing children reports dating from 1999. <a
          href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/02/are-there-hundreds-of-thousands-of-sex-trafficked-runaways-in-the-united-states/">About 115 of the 800,000 reported were victims of kidnapping by a stranger or distant
          contact.</a> Most of the incidents were
        considered runaways or instances of caregiver miscommunication. Think: one parent in a custody battle keeps their kid for longer than their court-allotted time and the other parent calls the police.
        <br><br>
        This data is more than twenty years old. What is the real data in 2020?
        <br><br>
        421,394 missing-child incidents were reported to the FBI in 2019. And again, a large number of those kids are runaways - about 91%.

            66,667 is a number not traceable to any empirical studies. Children are considered a very low-risk category for COVID-19 deaths, so any quantified comparison to already-overblown kidnapping rates will have a numerical difference.
            <br><br>
            Also, 66,667 repeats the number 6, "the devil's number," and then has an extra number 7 at the end, probably so it doesn't look fabricated.

            Of the nearly 26,300 runaways reported to the National Center for Missing and Reported Children last year, the organization claims that 1 in 6 are sex trafficked. However, the organization does not get this statistic from a controlled
            study. It doesn't refer to all missing children, only the ones reported to the organization. They look at factors of location, income, gender and sexuality, and race, and use those numbers to determine the probability of trafficking for
            those 26,300 runaways. It's impossible to measure the amount of times something happened without actually measuring it, and NCMSC doesn't confirm whether these guesses are true.

            All instances of the sexual abuse of children are tragic. However, legislation such as SESTA/FOSTA in 2018, which took down Backpage and several other escort listing websites, has <ahref="https:

              where they are vulnerable to violence and over-policing. For example, a worker might not carry condoms while looking for clients outside. If a police officer stops them, possession of condoms is considered "probable cause" of
              prostitution.

        Consequences
      </h2>
      <p>
        Because the Federal Trafficking Victims Act of 2000 set the age of 18 as the dividing line for sale of sex, if a person is under 18, they're trafficked, even if no pimp is involved. So, if a teen running from a bad home situation trades a
        sexual act for a meal or a place to sleep at night, they are considered trafficked. The broad term "trafficking" abstracts the factors of poverty and displacement experienced by children.
        <br><br>
        These statistics are currently being used by far-right groups, including QAnon, in support of President Donald Trump. He signed an executive order earlier this year in effort to combat trafficking, turning over a $77 million budget to the
        Department of Justice.
        <br><br>
        As nonpartisan and partisan groups alike hunt for the statistics that will politicize their point, the social factors leading to child displacement go overlooked.
